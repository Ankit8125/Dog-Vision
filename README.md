# Dog-Vision üê∂üëÅÔ∏è
This repository contains a deep learning model designed to classify images of different dog breeds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview
The goal of the **Dog Vision** project is to build a model that can predict the breed of a dog from an image. We leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on a dataset of dog images for breed classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains images of various dog breeds. We trained the model on images from the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), which consists of over 20,000 images from 120 different dog breeds.

## TensorFlow Workflow
1. Get data ready (turn into Tensors)
2. Pick a model (to suit your problem)
3. Fit the model to the data and make a prediction
4. Evaluate the model
5. Improve through experimentation
6. Save and reload your trained model
